1. do the framework module for backend (saving names and scores, even if temporarily)
2. research Fastify and Node.js (node.js is javascript so need to learn that)

info we learned/thoght of so far:

What we need in general:
-   frontend
-   backend (server)
-   database

-   frontend = html?

-   for a backend server we need:
    - Backend programming language (javascript most likely)
    - Backend framework (fastify wirth node.js)
    - Package manager (?)

-   for the database we use MariaDB most likely
    - What data?
        - tournament info:
            - names for sure
            - scores maybe 

-   A request is info from frontend sent to server
-   A response is info sent from server to frontend

-   a request can have all kinds of info. such as the player names
-   backend needs to specify what kind of requests are okay
    -> list of allowed or disallowed requests is the API


for node.js on docker:

-   command: npm init -y (initializes with yes for all default options)
->  creates a package.json file on current path
-   npm install express (installs package, check first if thats an okay package to use)
    -> express is a framwork so this is where we instead get Fastify
